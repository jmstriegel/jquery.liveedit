<h2>jQuery LiveEdit Plugin - An alternative visual editor</h2>

<p>jquery.liveedit is intended to be a simpler alternative to WYSIWYG editors. LiveEdit converts textareas into editable markup suitable for inline editing.</p>

<h2>What is jquery.liveedit good for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>inline editing: editable content appears just as it would in its published state</li>
<li>controlled layouts: markup is constrained to simple, pre-defined elements</li>
<li>simplified markup: with normal use, it's difficult to produce wonky html</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is jquery.liveedit not ideal for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>completely free-from html: liveedit attempts to limit user interaction to the construction of headings and paragraphs</li>
<li>multi-level nesting: in keeping with simplified markup, liveedit attempts to keep things tidy at a single level of nested content</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<pre>
    Say you have the following HTML:

    &lt;div id="edittools"&ht;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;textarea id="editor"&ht;&lt;/textarea&gt;

    Apply the liveedit to your textarea. The textarea will be replaced with the live editor.
    $('#editor').liveedit();
    
    And add the ability to drag paragraphs, h1, h2, and images to the editor.
    $('#editor').liveedit('addtools', { 'target':'#edittools', 'enable': ['h1','h2','p','img'] });

    As updates are made to the live edit document, these changes will be reflected in the markup inside your hidden textarea and any form posts should work as usual.
